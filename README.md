weight
======

A re-implementation of the [Shopify "Money" gem](
https://github.com/Shopify/money), using BigDecimals to store
weight values.

The code is effectively a direct copy, with some appropriate changes made.


TODO:

* ensure that weight_parser allows values entered with commas - "2,123.123"
